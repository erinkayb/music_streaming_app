# Music Streaming App

Please open two terminal windows

## Installation

In first terminal (client):
```bash
cd client
```
```bash
npm install
```
In Second terminal (server):
```bash
cd server
```
```bash
npm install
```
## Post Installation

After everything is finished installing, run:

In first terminal (client):
```bash
npm run start
```
In Second terminal (server):
```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

After you have started the Client and Server, you can see the client at localhost:8080.

To query a date (serverside), you can go to www.unixtimestamp.com to get a specific timestamp, then go to postman and type localhost:3000/usage?from=TIMESTAMP.

You may also query all data by going to localhost:3000/all

## Design

For the client side design, I went with clean and ledgable with a touch of flare. The most important aspect was the data, so I made sure that was easy to read.

## Thank you!!
